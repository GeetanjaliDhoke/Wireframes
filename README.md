Overview

This repository features wireframe designs I, Geetanjali Dhoke, have created for various digital products and platforms. These wireframes reflect my ability to translate business requirements into intuitive, user-centric visual layouts that guide the design and development process.

Each wireframe demonstrates my understanding of user experience (UX) principles, stakeholder needs, and system functionalityâ€”serving as a visual blueprint for interface design and feature placement.
