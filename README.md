Overview

This repository features wireframe designs I, Geetanjali Dhoke, have created for various digital products and platforms. These wireframes reflect my ability to translate business requirements into intuitive, user-centric visual layouts that guide the design and development process.

Each wireframe demonstrates my understanding of user experience (UX) principles, stakeholder needs, and system functionalityâ€”serving as a visual blueprint for interface design and feature placement.

Structure of Each Wireframe Set:
1. Project Background
2. User Flow Description
3. Low-Fidelity Wireframes
4. Key Screens & Navigation

Skills Highlighted:
1. UX Research Interpretation
2. Visual Structuring of Business Logic
3. Wireframing Using Tools (e.g., Balsamiq, Figma, or Draw.io)
4. User Flow Design and Navigation Planning
5. Stakeholder Collaboration & Feedback Incorporation
6. Cross-functional Communication with Designers & Developers
